# What is K Nearset Neighbor ? 
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique

It should also be noted that all three distance measures are only valid for continuous variables. In the instance of categorical variables the Hamming distance must be used. It also brings up the issue of standardization of the numerical variables between 0 and 1 when there is a mixture of numerical and categorical variables in the dataset

Choosing the optimal value for K is best done by first inspecting the data. In general, a large K value is more precise as it reduces the overall noise but there is no guarantee. Cross-validation is another way to retrospectively determine a good K value by using an independent dataset to validate the K value. Historically, the optimal K for most datasets has been between 3-10. That produces much better results than 1NN.

## Data Set Information:

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 

I think that the initial data set had around 30 variables, but for some reason I only have the 13 dimensional version. I had a list of what the 30 or so variables were, but a.) I lost it, and b.), I would not know which 13 variables are included in the set. 

The attributes are (dontated by Riccardo Leardi, riclea '@' anchem.unige.it ) 
1) Alcohol 
2) Malic acid 
3) Ash 
4) Alcalinity of ash 
5) Magnesium 
6) Total phenols 
7) Flavanoids 
8) Nonflavanoid phenols 
9) Proanthocyanins 
10)Color intensity 
11)Hue 
12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines 
13)Proline 

In a classification context, this is a well posed problem with "well behaved" class structures. A good data set for first testing of a new classifier, but not very challenging.
